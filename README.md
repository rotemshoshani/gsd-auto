# utilities

A grab bag of small personal tools — terminal launchers, timers, and automation around Claude Code / GSD workflows.

## Project-local launcher config

`dev-env`, `council`, and `prod-env` can read [`.rsh-utils.example.json`](.rsh-utils.example.json)
as a project-local configuration template. Copy it to `.rsh-utils.json` in the
directory where you launch a tool, then keep only the fields you need. The file
is not searched in parent directories or Git roots: the launch directory is the
scope. For `dev-env` and `council`, command-line options override environment
variables, which override project config and built-in defaults. `prod-env` gets
its monitor list directly from project config.

The example is the canonical schema and is validated in tests. Update it with
every supported config change. Do not place secrets in `.rsh-utils.json`.

## Projects

### [arch-advisor](arch-advisor/)
Autonomous tmux runner for repeated AI architecture and performance review passes. It writes code-referenced findings and optimization plans around deployment, database/query patterns, caching, runtime hot paths, observability, and cost/performance tradeoffs.

### [cc-commands](cc-commands/)
Source of truth for custom Claude Code slash commands (`/0-done`, `/0-sync`, `/0-teach`, etc.). Files here get copied into `~/.claude/commands/` via the sync command.

### [herdr-codex-auto](herdr-codex-auto/)
Event-driven Herdr watcher that presses `p` for Codex command-permission prompts while leaving ordinary questions untouched. It only watches existing Codex panes in the current workspace when explicitly launched. The older tmux implementation remains under `archive/codex-auto/`.

### [council](council/)
A tmux launcher for brainstorming with two AI CLIs side-by-side — Claude Code on the left, Codex on the right — with a controller bar that relays one model's last reply to the other on a single keypress.

### [codex-delay](codex-delay/)
Terminal UI for scheduling one prompt into a fresh or existing Codex session after a countdown. It discovers resumable sessions for the current repository and launches through the local `cdx` alias.

### [dev-env](dev-env/)
Tiny tmux launcher for projects with two long-running dev processes (default: `npx convex dev` and `npm run dev`). Single-keypress controller for restarting either pane or tearing the session down.

### [gsd-auto](gsd-auto/)
Terminal-native automation controller for GSD workflows. Watches a tmux pane running Claude Code and auto-injects `/gsd-plan-phase` / `/gsd-execute-phase` so phase-based projects can run unattended overnight. Multiple iterations live here; `v4` is current.

### [interval-timer](interval-timer/)
Browser-based interval/HIIT timer. Open `index.html`, import a CSV of exercises (name, work, rest, repeat), and the runner cues each transition with audio clips from `Audio/` or browser TTS.

### [pomodoro-tui](pomodoro-tui/)
Terminal Pomodoro timer (`pomopp`) that splits work into smaller chunks — `--work 10x5 --rest 10` runs five 10-minute cuts before a rest, so you only think about the next cut rather than a full session.

### [prompt-queue](prompt-queue/)
Tmux controller for feeding Codex a queue of prompts one at a time. Each prompt gets a fresh Codex process, a 45-minute run window, a captured worker pane, and then a clean worker restart before the next prompt.

### [prod-env](prod-env/)
Config-driven tmux dashboard for production monitors. It has structured Convex error filtering, Vercel deployment status and failed-build logs, arbitrary command panes, and automatic layouts for one to nine monitors.

### [statusline](statusline/)
Custom Claude Code statusline (Node script) showing model, current task or GSD phase state, working directory, and context usage. `install.sh` wires it into Claude Code's settings.

### [slp](slp/)
Repository copy of the `slp` countdown command, accepting seconds, `MM:SS`, or `HH:MM:SS`.
